It depends on how precise you want it.

At the level of the year, a rough first order translation is:
Gregorian = 622 + Hijri * 354/365.25

Then you can refine that further if you want to convert day-month-year, using 1st Muharram 1 A.H. = July 16, 622 to calibrate, as well as the fact that on average, one hijri month is 29.5 days and one hijri year is about 354 days.
354.3 days to be precise.

One approach I can think of is this:
First, convert the Gregorian date of 1 Muharram 1 A.H. into a float in terms of Gregorian years.
So that would mean 1 Muharram 1 A.H. would be:
622+6/12+16/365 = 622.54 years Gregorian

Then you could look at the Hijri date, and calculate how many Hijri years after 1 Muharram 1 A.H. have elapsed.
For example, today is 4 Dhul Qadah (month 11) 1436.
So that would give (1436-1)+(11-1)/12+(4-1)/354.3 = 1435.84 years Hijri.

Then you could convert this second figure to Gregorian years elapsed.
1435.84 * 354.3/365.24 = 1392.83

Then you add the Gregorian years elapsed to the year of the start in Gregorian. Which gives 622.54+1392.83 = 2015.37

Which is off by a bit. That would be sometime in mid May, 2015.

I guess once you got that calibrated properly, you could convert the decimal of the elapsed part of the current year into months and days.
For example, .37 years is 4.44 months, which means April has passed, it's May, and then .44 of a month is about 13 days, so May 13th.

But like I said some calibration and careful attention to rounding errors is important
