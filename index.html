        Hijri calendar, which is based on lunar movement in the solar system,
        involves changes that are difficult to track. Any good translation must
        thus take into account the need to convert dates between different
        calendars. It is necessary to know how to convert solar dates into the
        Gregorian calendar and vice versa. This requires a full understanding of
        the Gregorian, solar and lunar months including how many days each
        contains, what a leap year is, and so on.

                The Gregorian calendar was proclaimed by

                states

                October 15 in the new calendar, correcting the accumulated
                discrepancy between the Julian calendar and the equinox from
                that date. When comparing historical dates, it is important to
                note that the Gregorian calendar used universally today in
                Western countries and in international commerce was adopted at
                different times by different countries. Britain and her colonies
                (including what is now the United States), did not switch to the
                Gregorian calendar until 1752, when Wednesday 2nd September in
                the Julian calendar dawned as Thursday the 14th of September in
                the Gregorian.

                  >February, the shortest month in the Gregorian calendar, is 28

                The Gregorian calendar offers a minor correction to the Julian.
                In the Julian calendar, <b>every fourth year</b> is a leap year
                in which February has 29 rather than 28 days, but in the
                Gregorian calendar, years <b>divisible by 100</b> are not leap
                years unless they are also <b>divisible by 400.</b> As in the
                Julian calendar, days are considered to
                <b>begin at midnight.</b> The average length of a year in the
                Gregorian calendar is 365.2425 days compared with the actual
                solar tropical year (time from equinox to equinox) of
                <b>365.24219878 days</b>, so the calendar
                <b
                  >accumulates one day of error with respect to the solar year
                  about every 3300 years.</b
                >
                As this is a purely solar calendar, no attempt is made to
                synchronise the start of months to the phases of the Moon. While
                one cannot properly speak of ‘Gregorian dates’ prior to the
                adoption of the calendar in 1582, the calendar can be
                extrapolated to prior dates. When this is done, a convention is
                applied that the year prior to year 1 is year 0. This differs
                from the Julian calendar in which there is no year 0—the year
                before year 1 in the Julian calendar is year ?1(minus 1).
                <b
                  >The date December 30th in the Gregorian calendar corresponds
                  to January 1st in the Julian calendar.</b
                >
                A slight modification of the Gregorian calendar
                <b>would make it even more precise.</b> If the additional rule
                that years evenly divisible by 400 are not leap years is given
                effect, an average solar year of 365.24225 days per year is
                obtained, which, compared to the actual mean year of
                365.24219878,
                <b
                  >is equivalent to an error of one day over a period of about
                  19,500 years;</b
                >
                this is comparable to errors resulting from tidal braking of the
                rotation of the Earth.

                the /sleep, coma, sopor, rest/ which is clear coming from the
                Jewish meaning of this day the day of rest), add to that, the

                The calendar presented here is the most commonly used civil
