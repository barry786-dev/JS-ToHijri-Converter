> Hijri calendar, which is based on lunar movement in the solar system, involves changes that are difficult to track. 
> Any good translation must thus take into account the need to convert dates between different calendars. It is necessary to know how to convert solar dates into the Gregorian calendar and vice versa. This requires a full understanding of the Gregorian, solar and lunar months including how many days each contains, what a leap year is, and so on.

## Calendars
*  The Gregorian calendar
> The Gregorian calendar was proclaimed by **Pope Gregory XIII** and came into effect in most Catholic states **in 1582**.  **October 4, 1582 of the Julian calendar was followed by October 15 in the new calendar**, correcting the accumulated discrepancy between the Julian calendar and the equinox from that date.
> When comparing historical dates, it is important to note that the Gregorian calendar used universally today in Western countries and in international commerce was adopted at different times by different countries. Britain and her colonies (including what is now the United States), did not switch to the Gregorian calendar until 1752, when Wednesday 2nd September in the Julian calendar dawned as Thursday the 14th of September in the Gregorian.

2.February | 28 | 8.August | 31
3.March | 31 | 9.September | 30
4.April | 30 | 10.Octobe | 31
5.May | 31 | 11.November | 30
6.June | 30 | 12.December | 31

>**February, the shortest month in the Gregorian calendar, is  28 or 29 days** depending on whether it occurs in a **leap year** or not. The Gregorian calendar offers a minor correction to the Julian. In the Julian calendar, **every fourth year** is a leap year in which February has 29 rather than 28 days, but in the Gregorian calendar, years **divisible by 100** are not leap years unless they are also **divisible by 400**. As in the Julian calendar, days are considered to **begin at midnight**.
> The average length of a year in the Gregorian calendar is **365.2425 days** compared with the actual solar tropical year (time from equinox to equinox) of **365.24219878 days**, so the calendar **accumulates one day of error with respect to the solar year about every 3300 years**. As this is a purely solar calendar, no attempt is made to synchronise the start of months to the phases of the Moon.
> While one cannot properly speak of ‘Gregorian dates’ prior to the adoption of the calendar in 1582, the calendar can be extrapolated to prior dates. When this is done, a convention is applied that the year prior to year 1 is year 0. This differs from the Julian calendar in which there is no year 0—the year before year 1 in the Julian calendar is year ?1(minus 1). **The date December 30th in the Gregorian calendar corresponds to January 1st in the Julian calendar**.
> A slight modification of the Gregorian calendar **would make it even more precise**. If the additional rule that years evenly divisible by 400 are not leap years is given effect, an average solar year of 365.24225 days per year is obtained, which, compared to the actual mean year of 365.24219878, **is equivalent to an error of one day over a period of about 19,500 years**; this is comparable to errors resulting from tidal braking of the rotation of the Earth.

*  The Lunar calendar
> The lunar calendar (also known as the Islamic, **Muslim and Hijri calendar**) is purely lunar and consists of twelve alternating **months of 30 and 29 days**, with the **final 29-day month extending to 30 days during leap years**. Leap years follow a 30-year cycle and occur in years 1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26, and 29. **Days are considered to begin at sunset**. The calendar begins on **Friday, July 16th, 622 C.E.** in the Julian calendar, **Julian day 1948439.5**, the day of **Prophet Muhammad's PBUH migration from Mecca to Medina**, with sunset on the preceding day reckoned as the first day of the first month of year **1 A.H.**, (Hegira, the Arabic word for Peregrination) The days are named in accordance with their position in the week; thus : Sunday is the first day (Ahad in Arabic means the one) , Monady (Iethnayn in Arabic means the the two )....etc but Friday the 6th (Jumaah means the gathering, meeting togther), and Saturday the 7th (Assabtt means in arabic the /sllep, coma, sopor, rest/ which is clear coming from the Jewish meaning of this day the day of rest), add to that, the week is considered to begin on Saturday as Friday is the holiday for Muslims

> The calendar presented here is the most commonly used civil calendar in the Islamic world; **for religious purposes**, months are marked to start with the first observation of **the crescent of the new Moon**.  As a result of this, the same Gregorian date may have **two to four** Hijri equivalent dates depending on the place and time of the **crescent sighting**.
> As an attempt to rationalise the various systems in use at that time, it was agreed that the most appropriate reference point for the Islamic Calendar was the Hijra (Hijrah, Hegira). The Islamic (Hijri) Calendar -with dates that fall within the Muslim Era- is usually **abbreviated to AH** in Western languages from the Latinised **'Anno Hejirae' (meaning ‘in the year of the Hijra’).**

* please note that I assume in my calculation that Hijri year is 354.366 to be precise as much as I can
* the Hijr Year starts at **July,19,622 AD** which is equelivant to **Friday 01/01/1 AH (Friday 01 Muharam 1 Hijri year)**
* The program need to take care for some special dates and points to be accurate , but this I will do later, but the program can still give you the nearest date to 99% right.
* I need to care for the month later if the date was between 29 and 30 and that needs some calculation and I was not in good mood to do it today , so I will make it later
